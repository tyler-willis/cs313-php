                    Hello!<br>
                    My name is Tyler Willis. I am a Software Engineering Major from West Richland, Washington. This is my seventh semester here at BYU-Idaho and I have loved it, but I am so glad to be graduating soon. I recently proposed to my girlfriend and she said yes! We are getting married at the end of this summer. Her name is Kristen and she is a Biochemistry major.<br><br><br><br><br>

                    Here is a picture I took last fall while my<br>
                    fiance and I were visiting Yellowstone<br>
                    National Park. The elk were so used to<br>
                    people that they let us walk right up next<br>
                    to them and take pictures. On that trip<br>
                    we also saw tons of buffalo (of course),<br>
                    a few wolves, and even a bear with 3<br>
                    cubs. We both love nature and plan on<br>
                    taking many outdoorsy trips when we're<br>
                    married.
